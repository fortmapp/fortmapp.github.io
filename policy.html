            <p class="mb-4">PALAS ATENA SOLUTIONS LTDA ("PALAS ATENA") operates <a href="https://fortmapp.github.io/"
                    class="text-blue-500 underline">https://fortmapp.github.io/</a>, <a

                    class="text-blue-500 underline">https://www.overwolf.com/app/Alberico_Dias_Barreto_Filho-Fortmapp</a>
                and may operate other websites and apps. It
                is PALAS ATENA policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
                our websites.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Website & App Visitors</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Like most website operators, PALAS ATENA collects non-personally-identifying information of
                the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PALAS ATENA's purpose in
                collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PALAS ATENA visitors use
                its website. From time to time, PALAS ATENA may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">PALAS ATENA also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
                Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a
                    href="https://fortmapp.github.io/" class="text-blue-500 underline">https://fortmapp.github.io/</a>
                blogs/sites. PALAS ATENA only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except
                that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the
                blog/site where the comment was left.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Certain visitors to PALAS ATENA websites choose to interact with PALAS ATENA in ways that
                require PALAS ATENA to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
                that PALAS ATENA gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign
                up at <a href="https://fortmapp.github.io/"
                    class="text-blue-500 underline">https://fortmapp.github.io/</a> to provide a username and email
                address. Those who engage in transactions with PALAS ATENA are asked to provide additional information,
                including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In
                each case, PALAS ATENA collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
                the purpose of the visitor's interaction with PALAS ATENA. PALAS ATENA does not disclose
                personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
                supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
                certain website-related activities.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">PALAS ATENA may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. PALAS
                ATENA may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, PALAS ATENA does not
                disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">PALAS ATENA discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to
                know that information in order to process it on PALAS ATENA's behalf or to provide services available at
                PALAS ATENA websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
                contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PALAS
                ATENA websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PALAS ATENA will not rent or
                sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to
                its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PALAS ATENA discloses
                potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
                subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PALAS ATENA believes in good faith that
                disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PALAS ATENA, third parties or
                the public at large. If you are a registered user of a PALAS ATENA website and have supplied your email
                address, PALAS ATENA may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
                feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with PALAS ATENA and our products. If you
                send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
                publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
                PALAS ATENA takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
                alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

                that PALAS ATENA goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
                that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
